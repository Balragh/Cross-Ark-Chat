Due to major changes i will be skipping to 5.0. Make sure to use all new config files as things have changed a lot.

Servers can now share settings with other servers.

Moved all log options to the application settings section.
Changed Map to NameTag in server settings.
Prefixs are now set to their own group. This will allow you to send messages to a list of servers instead of just one servers at a time. You can still put only one server in the list per prefix.
