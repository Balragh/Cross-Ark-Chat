## Ways to Contribute

If you want to contribute to the project you have a few ways of doing so.

* By creating better guides or even making a video on how to do things and ill add the link.
* By correcting spelling or wording of everything on my project. My spelling and wording is sometimes horrid :(
* By providing support for people that are having problems.
* By giving good ideas and feedback on how everything works or feels.
* By posting Issue reports with detailed information as to what bug or problem you have found.

### What to include in your Issue report

* Include what your problem is be as clear as possiable.
* Include what you was doing when the program crashed.
* Include your operating system information.
* Include log files if any.
* Include any screen shots if you taken any.
* Include your config file just blur or delete the sensitve information out like the password, and discord bot token.

Example issue report.
```
Hello i am having a problem with the program not starting for the first time. I have followed the install guide and confirmed all settings are correct for discord and Ark Servers.

My OS information is Windows 8 pro 64bit. (You can include ram or other information but not needed)
Every time i run the CrossArkChat.exe i get this error message. 
[Insert log file or paste error information here]
Here is a screen shot (if needed)
[screenshot.png here]
Here is config file.
[screenshot.png or just copy paste config here] (Again leave sensitive information out)
```

### What to include when suggesting ideas

* Give as much information about your idea that you can think of. Things like make it blue wont cut it and doesnt help. You dont need a full drawn out blueprint just give what information you have thought about or at least be clear enough that anyone that is not you will understand.
* Include screen shots or links to things simular to what you are asking for. The more information you give the better chance your idea will be added.
* Read past suggestions first so we dont keep saying the same things over and over. If you have same idea but want to add to it then just add yours to the comments with more information. If your idea is kinda simular but different create your own post but include link to the one you think is simular just note the different route you are wanting to take.
* If you want to improve on a feature say which feature you want to improve and what your idea is to make it better.
* Include your reason why the change you want is better and how you think it will improve the program.

Example idea.
```
Hello i would like to suggest adding a bad word filter to keep certian words from being sent to all my servers.

The way i think it can be added is by having a file i can add any word i dont want to see so i can keep my servers chat cleaner.

Link to something simular [insert link here] or screenshots of simular idea.

Example would be if i put DodoRex in the file it will either delete the word or add **** to replace it. Personally i would like for it to delete the word.
```

### what to include when making typo corrections or improving guides

* For typoes or improving guides not much to say here just include a snippet of what needs to be changed and why. Example Hey spikey here is snippet from install guide of a few spelling or wording changes to make it cleaner or clear for people to read.
* For any videos you want to make for a guide just make sure to be clear have good video quality is all i ask.

Example for typos or guide updates
