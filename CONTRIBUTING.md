When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owner of this repository before making a change.

## Ways to Contribute

If you want to contribute to the project you have a few ways of doing so.

* By creating better guides or even making a video on how to do things and ill add the link.
* By correcting spelling or wording of everything on my project. My spelling and wording is sometimes horrid :(
* By optimizing code or helping with adding new features.
* By providing support for people that are having problems.
* By giving good ideas and feedback on how everything works or feels.
* By posting Issue reports with detailed information as to what bug or problem you have found.

### What to include in your Issue report

* Include what your problem is be as clear as possiable.
* Include what you was doing when the program crashed.
* Include your operating system information.
* Include log files if any.
* Include any screen shots if you taken any.
* Include your config file just blur or delete the sensitve information out like the password, and discord bot token.

Example issue report.
```
Hello i am having a problem with the program not starting for the first time. I have followed the install guide and confirmed all settings are correct for discord and Ark Servers.

My OS information is Windows 8 pro 64bit. (You can include ram or other information but not needed)
Every time i run the CrossArkChat.exe i get this error message. 
[Insert log file or paste error information here]
Here is a screen shot (if needed)
[screenshot.png here]
Here is config file.
[screenshot.png or just copy paste config here] (Again leave sensitive information out)
```

### What to include when suggesting ideas

* Give as much information about your idea that you can think of. Things like make it blue wont cut it and doesnt help. You dont need a full drawn out blueprint just give what information you have thought about or at least be clear enough that anyone that is not you will understand.
* Include screen shots or links to things simular to what you are asking for. The more information you give the better chance your idea will be added.
* Read past suggestions first so we dont keep saying the same things over and over. If you have same idea but want to add to it then just add yours to the comments with more information. If your idea is kinda simular but different create your own post but include link to the one you think is simular just note the different route you are wanting to take.
* If you want to improve on a feature say which feature you want to improve and what your idea is to make it better.
* Include your reason why the change you want is better and how you think it will improve the program.

Example idea.
```
Hello i would like to suggest adding a bad word filter to keep certian words from being sent to all my servers.

The way i think it can be added is by having a file i can add any word i dont want to see so i can keep my servers chat cleaner.

Link to something simular [insert link here] or screenshots of simular idea.

Example would be if i put DodoRex in the file it will either delete the word or add **** to replace it. Personally i would like for it to delete the word.
```

### What to include when suggesting code changes

Im not asking for leasons (tho i dont mind learning if your okay with explaing in detail or giving me links to read up on a better way)or thinking im better (im newish to coding so i know there are better ways) i like most just prefer the reason as to why your way is better so i know for future and can up my game. Blindly following doesnt help anyone in learning what makes things tick.

For anyone that becomes a contributer you can just go the ussal route when requesting changes instead of going the ticket route.

* Give as much information as possiable as to why your wanting to change the code. Because its better just doesnt cut it you dont have to give me a lesson on code (unless you want to :D) or anything that grand just provide a link or exlpain how your code works and how it is doing the job better. Example by using this code instead it allows the code to run cleaner or faster by x ammount while having fewer bugs. Or the code you are using is making it work harder due to this [insert reason or link to reason why] a cleaner way is to go this route [insert code] by reducing the redunacy you are able to increase proformace abd simply make the program happer.
* Make sure to include good comments on your code changes so its easy for me and anyone else working on the code to know what is going on.
* Make sure what your wanting to change works better and isnt just an alternate way that does the same thing with no benfits or any better. In coding we all know there are multi ways to do things some better than others but some does exzactly the same thing with the same proformace. I like to spend time upgrading for the better of the code and adding new ideas but spending time unnessarly changing code doesnt help anyone.

Example code change
```
Hello here is some code i that will make the program run better by fixing or improving [insert issue or improvment here].
[inset code with good comments]
Here is the reason this code is better 
[explain or provide link on method your using that shows its better]
```

### what to include when making typo corrections or improving guides

* For typoes or improving guides not much to say here just include a snippet of what needs to be changed and why. Example Hey spikey here is snippet from install guide of a few spelling or wording changes to make it cleaner or clear for people to read.
* For any videos you want to make for a guide just make sure to be clear have good video quality is all i ask.

Example for typos or guide updates
```
Hello spikey

In the install guide here is some changes to make to be clear and to fix some typos.

Here is a video i made on how to set things up.

Ect.
```
